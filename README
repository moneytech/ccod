C Cod/CSP is free software.  You may copy, distribute, and modify it 
under the terms of the License contained in the file COPYING 
distributed with this package.  This license is the same as the 
MIT/X Consortium license.

Versions of C Cod/CSP that have an odd minor version (the middle 
number in the release above), are development releases and should 
be considered as beta software.  Releases with even minor version 
numbers are intended to be production grade software.

To build C Cod/CSP from a source distribution, you first run the
configuration shell script in the top level distribution directory:

        ./configure

After running the configure script, the "make" command will build
things and "make install" will install things into their proper
location.  Note that you need to have write permission into the
directories into which things will be installed.

Documentation is available from the ./doc directory.
